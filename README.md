# React + Vite Note App 📝

## Updates and Infos 📣

‼ The project contains a barebone Front-End only ⚛React app, on which I am currently working on and testing making it my sandbox while learning React.
‼ The project scope is to create a modern-looking React NOTES app, like a reminder app (you know what I mean... 😂).
‼ The project for now sit in silent, while I work on other things, but I want this to be finished! 🤞

 
## What's Next 🔜

In the next version of this project I want to integrate and utilize 🍃TAILWINDCSS in order to handle and create a nice front end!
Not only that! For now the project as you can see has no Back-End, and I want to create some nice .NET logics to handle what I what to do!
Hope soon 😂

Thanks for coming by! 🙏
